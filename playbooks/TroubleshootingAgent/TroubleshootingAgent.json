  "goal": "Ensure the chatbot accurately captures user intent related to service issues, such as outages, no internet, WiFi password requests, modem reboots, and service reactivation, while mapping relevant parameters as per predefined guidelines. The chatbot must acknowledge the user's request and seamlessly transfer them to the appropriate resolution flow without asking for unnecessary details like account number, order number, address, or date. For service reactivation requests, the chatbot should not attempt to resolve the issue or ask for account details but should instead directly escalate or transfer the user to the correct support flow without friction.",
